# 204ducks
{EPITECH} | Second year | Math project

When ducks are disturbed by a sudden noise, they fly away almost simultaneously, leaving the pond empty.
Chances that a duck will then come back after t minutes are given by the following probability density
function.

where a is a real constant between 0 and 2.5, which depends on external factors (such as temperature, day time, duck’s health etc. ).

A study is being conducted about these ducks, and you are asked to compute and display the following, given the value of a:
1. The average time after which ducks come back,
2. The standard deviation of the ducks’ return time,
3. The time after which 50% of all of the ducks are back,
4. The time after which 99% of all of the ducks are back,
5. The percentage of ducks that come back after 1 minute,
6. The percentage of ducks that come back after 2 minutes.
